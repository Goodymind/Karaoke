23, When you were here before
28, Couldn't look you in the eye
34, You're just like an angel
39,Your skin makes me cry
44,You float like a feather
49,In a beautiful world
55,I wish I was special
61,You're so very special
67,But I'm a creep
72,I'm a weirdo
77,What the hell am I doin' here?
83,I don't belong here
89,I don't care if it hurts
94,I wanna have control
100,I want a perfect body
105,I want a perfect soul
111,I want you to notice
116,When I'm not around
122,So fuckin' special
127,I wish I was special
133,But I'm a creep
139,I'm a weirdo
144,What the hell am I doin' here?
130,I don't belong here
157,She's running out the door (run)
160,She's running out
167,She run, run, run, run
