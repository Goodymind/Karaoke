23, When you were here before
28, Couldn't look you in the eye
34, You're just like an angel
39, Your skin makes me cry
45, You float like a feather
50, In a beautiful world
56, I wish I was special
61, You're so very special
67, But I'm a creep
72, I'm a weirdo
77, What the hell am I doin' here?
83,I don't belong here
87,I don't care if it hurts
96,I wanna have control
100,I want a perfect body
106,I want a perfect soul
111,I want you to notice
117,When I'm not around
123,So fuckin' special
128,I wish I was special
133,But I'm a creep
139,I'm a weirdo
144,What the hell am I doin' here?
149,I don't belong here
157,She's running out the door (run)
170,She's running out
180,She run, run, run, run
